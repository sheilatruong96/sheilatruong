		<h4>
			User Interviews
		</h4>

		<p>
			Before I even thought about what I want my portfolio to look like, I conducted 5 interviews with users in different fields and positions, in order to figure out what contents I should include in my portfolio. I found that it was really helpful hearing different opinions because I was able to get an insight as to why people thought certain features are important to include and not include. The questions that I asked started off with getting to know their backgrounds, their opinions on having a portfolio, what feature they think is most important to have, what features should not be included, and any concerns they might have about a portfolio.

		<h4>
			Competitor Analysis
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			Competitor analysis are done on other competitors who are also working on a portfolio in order to see what features they have in their portfolio that I find useful to include in mine or techniques that they used that didn’t work out so I know to not include them. The types of competitors that I chose to include are students that are in a related major as me such as computer science, software engineering, UX designer, and etc. From my research, I notice that people who like to design have really creative and aesthetically pleasing portfolios. In addition, students that are interested in the less creative side have really informative and simply designed layouts that showcase their projects and work experiences. So from my competitor analysis I decided to focus on more of my content, while having a clean and simple layout for my portfolio.

		<h4>
			Feature Value Matrix
		</h4>
		
		<p >
			Creating a feature value matrix help to see all the features you want to include in your portfolio and ranking them by “User Value”, “Business Value”, and “Development Effort” in order to see which feature is most valuable in the project. Each of my features I wrote a small description that explains why I need this feature. Feature value matrix allows me to organize my thoughts and focus on the main important features every portfolio must have such as: email, name, profile picture, about me, skills, experience, and etc. I included features that we must have for the project and a couple of additional features that I wanted to include in my portfolio.

			Feature Prioritization
		</h4>
		
		<p >
			Using the feature value matrix’s total ranking number I was able to determine which feature I should implement first for my portfolio. Then I ordered the features in a prioritization chart where the features on the right requires high priority and the ones on the left requires less priority. Having all these cool features in my portfolio would be nice, but doing the prioritization helps focus my attention on the features that overall should be taken care of first.

		<h4>
			User Stories
		</h4>
		
		<p >
			User stories helped me to rethink all of my features and ask myself why did I include certain features and how will it benefit me. The steps I took to write my stories is to pick a feature and think who will be needing/using this feature. Then I would pretend I was that person and think what would I want to accomplish and how will having this feature help me accomplish it. I did this for all of my features covering all types of users: students, hiring managers, recruiters, and etc.

		<h4 >
			Cognitive Walkthrough
		</h4>
		<p >
			A cognitive walkthrough is when you ask a user to perform a specific task and see if there run into any obstacles. While they are performing the task, the users are asked to speak out loud because it will help me see what goes on in their mind as they are scrolling through my portfolio. This type of testing is important to conduct because users are actually interacting with my portfolio. Since it was in person, I was able to talk to the user and ask why did they press a certain button and what is going through their minds. One big problem I had with my cognitive walkthroughs was that users would constantly scroll up in order to use my navigation bar.

		<h4 >
			User Test
		</h4>
		
		<p >
			I created a total of 4 tests, which includes 1 question test and 3 click tests. I chose to use a question test because I had some concerns about my portfolio after the cognitive walkthroughs, so I wanted to get more opinions about it. The click tests were helpful because I wanted to see if users know how to navigate and click on the right spots in my portfolio. One big challenged I faced is that I had people who were not in my class to take the tests, so they were unfamiliar with how the website worked. Therefore, they didn’t read the question before jumping into the click tests and ended up clicking in random spots of the screens. For the people that read the questions before jumping into the click tests gave me perfect results. However, next time I conduct a click test I’ll change it to just one click because originally I had it at two clicks and people were confused as to why nothing happened. The question tests were pretty straightforward, I got mixed answers but for a majority of them I had consistent results.

			Summary of Findings
		</h3>
		<p >
			When we were first assigned this project I was overwhelmed. I didn’t know what to do first I was just so scared because I am not a creative person. I like to have a list of steps and just follow it step by step. Conducting all the research I learned that not all portfolios have to be super animated and have crazy transitions, instead I could incorporate my own style and personality into my portfolio. Although its not the best looking one out there, I tried to make the content of my portfolio strong and from my research a lot of users said that they wanted a portfolio that was easy to use and have all the basic features: contact, bio, skills, experience, and projects.
		</p>

		<p >
			Therefore, the materials that we learned in class and my user researched I was able to focus on a small step at a time. Building my portfolio mobile first was a challenge because every time I get a new idea, I realized that it would only work on a desktop (i.e. the hover feature). Also, through user testing I learned that everyone will have different opinions and it will be impossible to create a portfolio that will satisfy everyone. Therefore, I just focused on what I want to put in my portfolio and making sure I have the core features that make up a portfolio while satisfying all the project requirements.

			Incorporation of Findings
		</h3>
		<p >
			Through my cognitive walkthrough I had mixed reactions to the background color of my portfolio. Some people hated it because it was white and hurt their eyes, but other people love that it compliments with the purple and gray. For my future revisions, I want to play around with different colors for my background and see how that looks. Another thing that I want to add is to make my navigation bar stick to the top when people scroll down the page because in my cognitive walk through I noticed that people had to scroll up or just up and down the page to find a particular section. I think to add in the sticky navigation bar would require some JavaScript and I have not had any experience up until this class with JavaScript so that will probably be a struggle for me.
		</p>

		<p>
			Some things that I had already changed about my portfolio is that I made the font size a little bit bigger because users complained that the texts were so tiny and it made the white background stand out even more. In addition, users also asked to make my profile picture bigger because the size I had before was too small giving off the impression that I am not a person with confidence and proud to be presenting my portfolio. Overall, based off of the feedback I got from user testing everything is simple and nice to look at besides not having a sticky navigation bar everything was straightforward and easy to use.
